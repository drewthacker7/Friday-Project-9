# Friday Project 9 â€“ ChatGPT GUI (Tkinter + OpenAI)

This project is a basic ChatGPT-style app using Python, Tkinter, and the OpenAI API. The app lets you type a prompt into a GUI window, click Submit, and get a GPT-generated response.

- Uses a `.env` file to keep the API key secure

    - Do NOT add spaces
    - Make sure itâ€™s only one line
